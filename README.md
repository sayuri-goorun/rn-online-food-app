## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Expo](https://expo.dev/). Ensure that you have the [Expo App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_ZA&gl=US) installed on your Android or IOS device to test the food store application.

1. Clone or Download the Git Repository

git clone https://gitlab.com/Sayurii/rn-online-food-app.git
```
2. Change into the project directory
```bash
cd rn-online-food-app/
```

3. Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the packages.

```bash
npm install

## Usage

To start the application run the following command:

```bash
npm start

Once the App has successfully launched, you will notice a web page on your browser that pops up. Scan the QR Code that appears on the bottom left of the web page from your [Expo App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_ZA&gl=US) on your mobile device. Within a few seconds you should have access to the food delivery app.
